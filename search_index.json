Definition 2.2 (Smoothness in half spaces) Let \\(S\\) be an open subset of \\(\\mathbb H^n\\), and \\(f: S \\to \\mathbb R^m\\). The function \\(f\\) is said to be smooth at \\(p \\in S\\) in \\(\\mathbb H^n\\) if it admits an smooth extension in a neighborhood of \\(p\\) relative to \\(\\mathbb R^n\\).
