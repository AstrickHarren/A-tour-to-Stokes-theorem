Basic kownledge on topology and equivalence relations is the only prerequisite. In spirit, the note does not even assume knowledge as fundamental as limits or derivatives, but the reader should be reasonably familiar with them to this extend. In addition, the note is solely committed to its purpose, that is, the proof/construction of the Stoke’s theorem, and it stays to its focus. Hence famous results may be omitted even in places where it comes out naturally. Those who wish to dive deeper are encouraged to consult any other introductory books on differential geometry.

Definition 2.2 (Locally finite) A collection of subsets \\(\\mathcal A\\) of \\(X\\) is said to be locally finite in \\(X\\) if \\(x\\) has a neighborhood intersecting only finite many sets in \\(\\mathcal A\\) for all \\(x ∈ X\\). Definition 2.3 (Partition of unity) A collection of smooth functions \\(\\mathcal R = \\{ρ: U → I = [0, 1]\\}\\) is said to be a smooth partition of unity on open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\) if The supports \\[\\{\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ: ρ ∈ \\mathcal R\\}\\] is locally finite in \\(X\\); For all \\(x ∈ U\\), \\[\\sum_{ρ ∈ \\mathcal R} ρ(x) = 1,\\] where the notation is defined as \\[\\sum_{ρ ∈ \\mathcal R}ρ(x) := \\sum_{ρ∈\\mathcal R, ρ(x) ≠ 0}ρ(x)\\] which is a finite sum by above local finiteness. Definition 2.4 (Bump function) A function \\(f: ℝ^n → I = [0, 1]\\) is a bump function at \\(x ∈ ℝ^n\\) supported in \\(U\\) if \\(f = 1\\) in a neighborhood of \\(x\\); \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}f ⊂ U\\). Theorem 2.1 For all \\(x ∈ ℝ^n\\) and \\(U\\) one of its neighborhoods in \\(ℝ^n\\), there exists a smooth bump function at \\(x\\) supported in \\(U\\). Proof. The building block is \\[f(x) = \\cases{0 &amp; x ≤ 0\\\\ \\exp(-1/x) &amp; x ≥ 0}\\] Obviously \\(f\\) is smooth at all points except possibly \\(0\\), easy computation shows \\[f^{(n)}(x) = O\\left({\\frac{\\exp(-1/x)}{P(x)}}\\right) \\quad \\mathop{\\mathrm{as}}x → 0\\] for some polynomial \\(P\\) depending on \\(n\\). Notice \\(f^{(0)}(0) = 0\\), if \\(f^{(n)}(0) = 0\\), \\[\\frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{x} = O\\left({\\frac{\\exp(-1/x)}{P(x)x}}\\right) → 0 \\quad \\mathop{\\mathrm{as}}x → 0\\] shows \\(f^{(n+1)}(0) = 0\\) and then \\(f\\) is smooth on all \\(ℝ\\). Define \\(g: ℝ → ℝ\\) by \\[g(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{f(x) + f(1-x)}.\\] The function \\(g\\) is a smooth function that behaves like a step function: \\[g(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x ≤ 0\\\\ 1 &amp; x ≥ 1 \\end{cases}\\] If \\(n = 1\\), \\(x = 0\\), \\(U = (-2r, 2r)\\), choose any \\(0 &lt; s &lt; r\\) and define \\[ρ(x) = g\\left({\\frac{r^2 - x^2}{r^2 - s^2}}\\right)\\] then \\(ρ\\) is smooth, and \\[ρ(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\lvert{x}\\rvert ≤ s\\\\ 0 &amp; \\lvert{x}\\rvert &gt; r \\end{cases}\\] therefore, \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ ⊂ [-r, r] ⊂ U\\). In general, there is an open ball \\(B\\) with radius \\(2r\\) around \\(x\\) contained in \\(U\\), put \\[σ(x) = ρ(\\lvert{x}\\rvert)\\] gives a smooth bump function that has support in \\(B\\). The function is smooth because \\(\\lvert{x}\\rvert^2\\) is smooth (even when \\(\\lvert{x}\\rvert\\) itself is not) and \\(ρ\\) is a composition that takes square as its innermost function. Proposition 2.1 Every open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\) has a decomposition of open sets with compact closures \\[U = \\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ V_i\\] such that \\[∅ = V_0 ⊂ \\bar{V}_0 ⊂ V_1 ⊂ \\bar{V}_1 ⊂ ⋯ ⊂ U\\] Proof. Notice the collection \\[\\mathcal B = \\{B: \\text{$B$ is an open ball such that $\\bar B ⊂ U$}\\}\\] covers \\(U\\), and each open ball has a compact closure in \\(U\\). Recursively define \\(V_1 = B_1\\) for any \\(B_1 ∈ \\mathcal B\\); \\(V_n\\) has compact closure in \\(U\\) by induction hypothesis, and hence is covered by a finite sets in \\(\\mathcal B\\). Define \\[V_{n+1} := B_1 ∪ B_2 ∪ ⋯ ∪ B_{N+1}\\] for some \\(N\\) such that \\(\\bar V_{n} ⊂ V_{n+1}\\). That \\(\\bar V_{n} \\not⊂ V_{n}\\) (otherwise \\(V_n\\) is both open and closed) shows in each step one must put an additional \\(B_{N+1} ∈ B\\) to define \\(V_{n+1}\\), and hence \\(N ≥ n\\), showing \\[\\bigcup V_n = \\bigcup B_n = U.\\] Theorem 2.2 For all open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\), and an open cover \\(\\mathcal G\\) of \\(U\\) with \\[U = \\bigcup_{W ∈ \\mathcal G}W,\\] there exists a smooth partition of unity \\(\\mathcal R\\) such that each \\(ρ ∈ \\mathcal R\\) has its support \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ ⊂ W\\) for some \\(W ∈ \\mathcal G\\). Proof. Let \\(\\{V_n\\}\\) be the decomposition of \\(U\\) given by previous proposition 2.1, define \\(K_n = \\bar{V}_{n+1}\\backslash V_n\\), \\(n = 0, …\\) \\(U_n = V_{n+1}\\backslash \\bar{V}_{n-1}\\), \\(n = 1, …\\) Clearly, \\(K_n\\) is compact while \\(U_n\\) is open; The union of \\(K_n\\) comprises \\(U\\); \\(\\{U_n\\}\\) is locally finite. Now since \\(K_n\\) is compact, by theorem 2.1, there exists a finite set of smooth functions1 \\[\\mathcal R_n = \\{ϕ: U → I\\}\\] such that \\(ϕ\\) is supported2 in \\(G ∩ U_n\\) for some \\(G ∈ \\mathcal G\\); \\[\\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R_n}ϕ(x) &gt; 0\\] for all \\(x ∈ K_n\\). Now that \\(\\{U_n\\}\\) is locally finite, \\(\\mathcal R_n\\) only contains finite many functions, this implies the supports of functions in \\[\\mathcal R := \\bigcup \\mathcal R_n\\] is locally finite (simple proof by contradiction), hence the sum \\[Φ = \\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R}ϕ ≥ \\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R_n}ϕ\\] is a finite sum positive on all \\(K_n\\) and their union \\(U\\). This well defines the collection \\[\\{\\frac{ϕ}{Φ}: ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R\\}\\] as the desired partition of unity on \\(U\\). Remark (Personal). I believe axiom of choice is involved in choosing a finite subcover in \\(\\mathcal G\\) for each compact \\(K_n\\) in construction of \\(\\mathcal R_n\\). The theorem justifies the existence of bump functions defined on \\(ℝ^n\\), we obtain \\(\\mathcal R_n\\) by taking their restrictions on \\(U\\).↩︎ The support of \\(ϕ\\) is taken wrto \\(U\\) not \\(ℝ^n\\) here. However, it make no difference as \\(U\\) is open in \\(ℝ^n\\), hence the result of theorem 2.1 still holds even if the bump function is restricted to \\(U\\).↩︎ "]]
