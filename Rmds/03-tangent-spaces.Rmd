# Tangent Spaces

```{definition, , name="Smoothness in manifolds"}

A function $f: U \to N$ defined on an open set of a manifold $M$ is smooth at
$p \in U$ if there are charts $(V, \phi), (W, \psi)$ centered at $p, f(p)$ resp. such that
$$
\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(V \cap U \cap f^{-1}(W)) \to \mathbb R^n
$$
is smooth at $p$ (in half spaces)

A function is smooth if it is smooth everywhere defined.

```

```{proposition}
Let $M, N, R$ be three manifolds, and $U, V$ open sets of $M, N$ resp. If functions
$$
f: U \to N, \quad
g: V \to R
$$
are defined such that for some point $p \in U$,

1. $f(p) \in V$
2. $f$ is smooth at $p$ and $g$ is smooth at $f(p)$

Then $g \circ f$ is smooth at $p$.
```

```{definition, , name="Germs"}

Suppose $M$ is a manifold, and $p \in M$. The germs of $M$ at $p$ are defined as
equivalence classes specified on the set of all functionals defined on a neighborhood
of $p$ such that

1. $f \sim g$ if they agrees on a (smaller) neighborhood of $p$.

The set of all germs of $M$ at $p$ is denoted as $C^{\infty}_p(M)$.
```

```{definition}

In similar fashion, define $C^\infty_p(M, N)$ as equivalance classes on the set of all
smooth functions defined on a neighborhood of $p \in M$ whose ranges are contained
in $N$ with the equivalence relation that

1. $f \sim g$ if they agrees on a (smaller) neighborhood of $p$.

```

```{proposition}
The germs $C^{\infty}_p(M)$ of a manifold at a point is a ring.
```

```{definition, , name="Tangent vectors"}

A *derivation* or tangent vector at a point $p \in M$ in a manifold is any function $D: C_p^\infty(M) \to \mathbb R$
such that
$$
D(fg) = (Df)g(p) + f(p)(Dg)
$$

The set of all tangent vectors at $p$ is called its tangent space, denoted by $T_pM$.
```

```{proposition}
Tangent space at any point in any manifold is a vector space.
```

```{definition, , name="Differential"}
Let $F \in C^\infty_p(M, N)$ be a smooth function defined on an open subset of a manifold $M$. If $F$ is smooth at $p$, then its differential
at $p$ is defined as the map
$$
F_*: T_pM \to T_{f(p)}N
$$
such that
$$
F_*(X)(f) = X(f \circ F)
$$
for all $f \in C^\infty_{F(p)}(N)$.
```

```{proposition}
Differentials are linear transformations between tangent spaces.
```

```{theorem, , name="Chain rule"}
If $F \in C^\infty_p(M, N), G \in C^\infty_f(p)(N, R)$, then
$$
(F \circ G)_* = F_* \circ G_*
$$
```

## Bases for Tangent Spaces

```{definition, , name="Partial derivative"}

If $M$ is a manifold, $p \in M$ is a point, and $\phi: U \to \mathbb R^n$ is a chart centered
at $p$. Write
$$
\phi = (x^1, \dots, x^n)
$$
where $x^i: U \to \mathbb R^n$. Define
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \in T_pM
$$
with
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}f = \left . \frac{\partial(f \circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial r^i} \right \rvert_{\phi(p)}
$$
where the right hand side is the usual partial derivative of functions defined in euclidean spaces.

```

```{theorem}

Let $M$ be a manifold, and $\phi = (x^1, \dots, x^n)$ be a chart at $p \in M$. The partial derivatives
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}, \quad \dots, \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}
$$
make up a basis for $T_pM$.

```

```{proof}

It suffices to prove $T\mathbb H^n$ has dimension $n$, or that $T\mathbb H^n \simeq R^n$.
Apply taylor's expansion with remainder on any $f \in C^\infty_p(\mathbb R^n)$ with
$$
f(x) = f(p) + \sum (x^i - p^i) g_i(x)
$$
where $g_i(p) = \left . \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right \rvert_p$.

```

```{proposition}

If $F \in C^\infty_p(M, N)$, then in local coordinates,

$$
F_*\left (\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right) = \sum \frac{\partial F^i}{\partial x^j} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}
$$
where
$F^i = y^i \circ F$.
