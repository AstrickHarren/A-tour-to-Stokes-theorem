# Partition of Unity

```{definition, , name="Support"}

The support of a function $f: X → ℝ$ of a topological space $X$ is the *closure* of the set

$$
\{x ∈ X: f(x) ≠ 0\}
$$

*relative to* $X$.

```

```{remark}

Always remember the support of a function is a closure taken relative to its *domain of definition*.

```

```{definition, name="Locally finite"}

A collection of subsets $\mathcal A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be locally finite in $X$ if

- all $x ∈ X$ has a neighborhood intersecting only finite many sets in $\mathcal A$.

```

```{definition, partition-of-unity, name="Partition of unity"}

A collection of smooth functions $\mathcal R = \{ρ: U → I = [0, 1]\}$ is said to be a smooth partition of unity on open set $U ⊂ ℝ^n$ if

1. The supports
    $$\{\supp ρ: ρ ∈ \mathcal R\}$$
    is locally finite in $X$;

2. For all $x ∈ U$,
    $$\sum_{ρ ∈ \mathcal R} ρ(x) = 1,$$
    where the notation is defined as
    $$\sum_{ρ ∈ \mathcal R}ρ(x) := \sum_{ρ∈\mathcal R, ρ(x) ≠ 0}ρ(x)$$
    which is a finite sum by above local finiteness.
```

```{theorem}
There exists a partition of unity for all open sets $U \in \mathbb R^n$.
