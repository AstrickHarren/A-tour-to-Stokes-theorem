Half Spaces
===

```{definition, , name="Half spaces"}

The half space of dimension $n$ is given as
$$
ℍ^n := \{x ∈ ℝ^n: π^n(x) ≥ 0\}
$$
where $π^n(x^1, …, x^n) = x^n$ is the $n$-th coordinate map.

```

```{definition, , name="Smoothness in half spaces"}

Let $S$ be an open subset of $\mathbb H^n$, and $f: S \to \mathbb R^m$. The function
$f$ is said to be smooth at $p \in S$ in $\mathbb H^n$ if it admits an smooth extension in a neighborhood
of $p$ relative to $\mathbb R^n$. That is,

1. There exists $g: N \to \mathbb R^m$ defined on an open set $N \in \mathbb R^m$ that
contains $p$
2. $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in N \cap S$.

If so, the differential of $f$ at $p$ is defined as the same of that of $g$.

In addition, function $f$ is said to be smooth in $\mathbb H^n$ (or simply smooth) if
$f$ is smooth at every point in $S$.

```{theorem}

A function $f: S \to \mathbb R^m$ is smooth in $\mathbb H^n$ if and only if it admits
an extension in a neighborhood of $S$ that is smooth in $\mathbb R^n$.

```{proposition}
\n

1. The composition of smooth functions are smooth.
2. Chain rule.
