# Manifolds

```{definition, , name="Locally Euclidean"}

A topologically space $M$ is locally Euclidean if for all point $p \in M$, there is a homeomorphism
$$
\phi: U \to \mathbb H^n
$$
defined on a neighborhood of $p$.

The pair $(U, \phi)$ (or simply $\phi$) is called a *chart* of $M$.

```

```{definition, , name="Topological Manifold"}

A topological manifold is a Hausdorff, second countable, locally Euclidean space.

```


```{definition, , name="Compactible Charts"}

Two charts of a topological manifold $(U, \phi), (V, \psi)$ are compactible, if
$$
\phi \circ \psi^{-1}: \psi(U \cap V) \to \phi(U \cap V), \quad
\psi \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)
$$
are smooth (in half spaces).

```

```{definition, , name="Altas"}

A (smooth) altas on a locally Euclidean space $M$ is a collection of pairwise
compactible charts.

```

```{definition, , name="Manifold"}

A smooth manifold is a topological manifold $M$ together with a maximal atlas.
This atlas is also called a *differnetial structure* of $M$.

```

```{remark}

Henceforth refer

1. manifolds as smooth manifolds
2. charts of a manifold as charts in the differential structure of the manifold

```

```{proposition}

Any altas is contained in a unique maximal altas. Therefore it is enough to
define the differential structure of manifold with an arbitrary atlas.

```

```{theorem, , name="Smooth invariance of dimension"}

If $\phi: U \to \mathbb R^n$, $\psi: V \to \mathbb R^m$ are two charts of a
smooth manifold $M$, then $n = m$.

```

```{proof}
Apply chain rule on the diffeomorphism $\phi \circ \psi^{-1}$ and its inverse.
