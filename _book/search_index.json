[["index.html", "A Tour to Stokes’ theorem Preface", " A Tour to Stokes’ theorem Astrick 2020-11-14 Preface Elementary analysis students are often mysteriously introduced to the Stokes’ theorem. In its elegant form \\[∫_{∂Ω} ω = ∫_Ω dω,\\] the greek letter \\(ω\\) denotes an ill-defined differential form, the integral is taken over an equally ill-defined surface \\(Ω\\), or manifold when speaking of higher dimensions, and \\(∂Ω\\) its again ill-defined boundary. As if ill-defined concepts are not enough, proofs of such a theorem can be found in introductory courses as well. As hard as instructors try, the ill-supported knowledge typically remains vague in the minds of math students and henceforth serves as a bane to those who wish to refine their understanding on the famous theorem. This note aims to present to such students a rigorous experience on the construction and proof of Stokes’ theorem and help undo their curses, and the note is solely committed to its purpose. That is, conventions are sometimes hardwired into contents and irrelevant famous results may be omitted at places where they come out most naturally. Those who long for more detailed and comprehensive experience should consult any other introductory book on smooth manifolds. On the bright side, minimal knowledge is required to tread through the note: basic topology and mathematical analysis are the only preliminaries. "],["partition-of-unity.html", "CHAPTER 1 Partition of Unity 1.1 Construction of Partition of Unity", " CHAPTER 1 Partition of Unity In elementary analysis courses, instructors present proofs of Stokes’ theorem in its simple forms first, usually on 2-dimensional rectangles. They then attempt to take this result to general domains in \\(ℝ^2\\) by decomposing them into such small rectangles, and argue the integrals over the entire domain is equal to the sum of those over the rectangles. Formally, such generalization of local conclusions to their global counterparts is performed with the help of a technique known as the partition of unity (definition 1.3). Definition 1.1 (Support) The support of a function \\(f: X → ℝ\\) of a topological space \\(X\\) is the closure of the set \\[ \\{x ∈ X: f(x) ≠ 0\\} \\] relative to \\(X\\). Remark. Always remember the support of a function is a closure taken relative to its domain of definition. Definition 1.2 (Locally finite) A collection of subsets \\(\\mathcal A\\) of a topological space \\(X\\) is said to be locally finite in \\(X\\) if all \\(x ∈ X\\) has a neighborhood intersecting only finite many sets in \\(\\mathcal A\\). Definition 1.3 (Partition of unity) A collection of smooth functions \\(\\mathcal R = \\{ρ: U → I = [0, 1]\\}\\) is said to be a smooth partition of unity on open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\) if The supports \\[\\{\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ: ρ ∈ \\mathcal R\\}\\] is locally finite in \\(X\\); For all \\(x ∈ U\\), \\[\\sum_{ρ ∈ \\mathcal R} ρ(x) = 1,\\] where the notation is defined as \\[\\sum_{ρ ∈ \\mathcal R}ρ(x) := \\sum_{ρ∈\\mathcal R, ρ(x) ≠ 0}ρ(x)\\] which is a finite sum by above local finiteness. 1.1 Construction of Partition of Unity Readers by now should be familiar with the routine process of generalizing local properties into compact sets, but we wish to take a step further and generalize them into open sets. Analogous to that compact sets asserts a finite subcover of any of its open cover, we wish to guarantee, for any open set, a partition of unity subordinate to any of its open cover. Definition 1.4 (Subordination) A partition of unity \\(\\{ρ_α: α ∈ A\\}\\) on \\(U\\) is said to be subordinate to an open cover \\(\\{U_α\\}\\) of \\(U\\) if \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ_α ⊂ U_α\\) for all \\(α ∈ A\\). To construct subordinate partitions of unity, it is crucial to find, for every open set, some function supported in that open set. The function can not be constantly \\(0\\), otherwise it is not helpful in partitioning the unity. The simplest such smooth functions there exist are the bump functions. Definition 1.5 (Bump function) A function \\(f: V → I = [0, 1]\\) of some open subset \\(V ⊂ ℝ^n\\) is a bump function at \\(p ∈ V\\) supported in \\(U\\) if \\(f = 1\\) in a neighborhood of \\(p\\).1 \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}f ⊂ U\\). Theorem 1.1 For all \\(p ∈ ℝ^n\\) and \\(U, V\\) are two of its neighborhoods in \\(ℝ^n\\), there exists a smooth bump function \\(f: V → I\\) at \\(x\\) supported in \\(U\\). Proof. The building block is \\[f(x) = \\cases{0 &amp; x ≤ 0\\\\ \\exp(-1/x) &amp; x ≥ 0}\\] Obviously \\(f\\) is smooth at all points except possibly \\(0\\), easy computation shows \\[f^{(n)}(x) = O\\left({\\frac{\\exp(-1/x)}{P(x)}}\\right) \\quad \\mathop{\\mathrm{as}}x → 0\\] for some polynomial \\(P\\) depending on \\(n\\). Notice \\(f^{(0)}(0) = 0\\), if \\(f^{(n)}(0) = 0\\), \\[\\frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{x} = O\\left({\\frac{\\exp(-1/x)}{P(x)x}}\\right) → 0 \\quad \\mathop{\\mathrm{as}}x → 0\\] shows \\(f^{(n+1)}(0) = 0\\) and then \\(f\\) is smooth on all \\(ℝ\\). Define \\(g: ℝ → ℝ\\) by \\[g(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{f(x) + f(1-x)}.\\] The function \\(g\\) is a smooth function that behaves like a step function: \\[g(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x ≤ 0\\\\ 1 &amp; x ≥ 1 \\end{cases}\\] If \\(n = 1\\), \\(p = 0\\), \\(U = (-2r, 2r)\\) and \\(V = ℝ\\), choose any \\(0 &lt; s &lt; r\\) and define \\[ρ(x) = g\\left({\\frac{r^2 - x^2}{r^2 - s^2}}\\right)\\] then \\(ρ\\) is smooth, and \\[ρ(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\lvert{x}\\rvert ≤ s\\\\ 0 &amp; \\lvert{x}\\rvert &gt; r \\end{cases}\\] therefore, \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ ⊂ [-r, r] ⊂ U\\). If \\(V = ℝ^n\\), there is an open ball \\(B\\) with radius \\(2r\\) around \\(p\\) contained in \\(U\\), put \\[σ(x) = ρ(\\lvert{x - p}\\rvert)\\] gives a smooth bump function that has support in \\(B\\). The function is smooth because \\(\\lvert{x - p}\\rvert^2\\) is smooth (even when \\(\\lvert{x - p}\\rvert\\) itself is not) and \\(ρ\\) is a composition that takes square as its innermost function. Finally, if \\(V\\) is any open subset of \\(ℝ^n\\), put \\[η = σ|_V\\] Obviously, the support2 \\[\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}η = \\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ|_V ⊂ \\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ ⊂ U\\] and \\(η = 1\\) in a neighborhood of \\(p\\) relative to \\(V\\) since \\(V\\) is open3. Proposition 1.1 Every open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\) has a decomposition of open sets with compact closures \\[U = \\bigcup_{n=1}^∞ V_i\\] such that \\[∅ = V_0 ⊂ \\bar{V}_0 ⊂ V_1 ⊂ \\bar{V}_1 ⊂ ⋯ ⊂ U\\] Proof. Notice the collection \\[\\mathcal B = \\{B: \\text{$B$ is an open ball such that $\\bar B ⊂ U$}\\}\\] covers \\(U\\), and each open ball has a compact closure in \\(U\\). Recursively define \\(V_1 = B_1\\) for any \\(B_1 ∈ \\mathcal B\\); \\(V_n\\) has compact closure in \\(U\\) by induction hypothesis, and hence is covered by a finite sets in \\(\\mathcal B\\). Define \\[V_{n+1} := B_1 ∪ B_2 ∪ ⋯ ∪ B_{N+1}\\] for some \\(N\\) such that \\(\\bar V_{n} ⊂ V_{n+1}\\). That \\(\\bar V_{n} \\not⊂ V_{n}\\) (otherwise \\(V_n\\) is both open and closed) shows in each step one must put an additional \\(B_{N+1} ∈ B\\) to define \\(V_{n+1}\\), and hence \\(N ≥ n\\), showing \\[\\bigcup V_n = \\bigcup B_n = U.\\] Theorem 1.2 For all open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\), and an open cover \\(\\mathcal G\\) of \\(U\\) with there exists a smooth partition of unity \\(\\mathcal R\\) such that each \\(ρ ∈ \\mathcal R\\) has its support \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ ⊂ W\\) for some \\(W ∈ \\mathcal G\\). Proof. Let \\(\\{V_n\\}\\) be the decomposition of \\(U\\) given by previous proposition 1.1, define \\(K_n = \\bar{V}_{n+1}\\backslash V_n\\), \\(n = 0, …\\) \\(U_n = V_{n+1}\\backslash \\bar{V}_{n-1}\\), \\(n = 1, …\\) Clearly, \\(K_n\\) is compact while \\(U_n\\) is open; The union of \\(K_n\\) comprises \\(U\\); \\(\\{U_n\\}\\) is locally finite. Now since \\(K_n\\) is compact, by theorem 1.1, there exists a finite set of smooth functions \\[\\mathcal R_n = \\{ϕ: U → I\\}\\] such that \\(ϕ\\) is supported in \\(G ∩ U_n\\) for some \\(G ∈ \\mathcal G\\); \\[\\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R_n}ϕ(x) &gt; 0\\] for all \\(x ∈ K_n\\). Now that \\(\\{U_n\\}\\) is locally finite, \\(\\mathcal R_n\\) only contains finite many functions, this implies the supports of functions in \\[\\mathcal R := \\bigcup \\mathcal R_n\\] is locally finite (simple proof by contradiction), hence the sum \\[Φ = \\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R}ϕ ≥ \\sum_{ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R_n}ϕ\\] is a finite sum positive on all \\(K_n\\) and their union \\(U\\). This well defines the collection \\[\\{\\frac{ϕ}{Φ}: ϕ ∈ \\mathcal R\\}\\] as the desired partition of unity on \\(U\\). Lemma 1.1 \\[ \\overline{\\bigcup_{α ∈ A}S_α} = \\bigcup_{α ∈ A}{\\overline{S_α}} \\] if \\(\\{S_α: α ∈ A\\}\\) is a collection of locally finite subsets of some topological space \\(X\\). Proof. Put \\(S = \\bigcup S_α\\), obviously \\[ \\bigcup \\bar{S}_α ⊂ \\bar S \\] since \\(\\bar S_α ⊂ \\bar S\\) for each \\(α ∈ A\\). Conversely, for any \\(x ∈ X\\), it has a neighborhood intersecting \\[S_{α_1}, …, S_{α_n}\\] for some \\(n\\), and if \\(x ∉\\bar S_α\\) for all \\(α\\), \\(x\\) has a neighborhood disjoint with any of the above sets and hence disjoint with the entire \\(S\\), and \\(x ∉ \\bar S\\). Corollary 1.1 For all open set \\(U ⊂ ℝ^n\\), and an open cover \\(\\{U_α: α ∈ A\\}\\) of \\(U\\), there exists a smooth partition of unity \\(\\{ρ_α: α ∈ A\\}\\) subordinate to it. Proof. Of course, let \\(\\mathcal R\\) be the partition of unity introduced by the theorem such that the support of every \\(σ ∈ \\mathcal R\\) is contained in \\(U_{α}\\) for some \\(α = τ(σ)\\) depending on \\(σ\\) in its construction.4 Define \\[ ρ_α = \\sum_{τ(σ) = α}σ \\] By lemma 1.1 \\[\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ_α ⊂ \\bigcup_{τ(σ) = α} \\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ ⊂ U_α\\] In addition, \\(\\{\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ_α\\}\\) is locally finite because any \\(x\\) intersecting with infinitely many \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ_α\\) will do so with infinitely many \\(\\bigcup_{τ(σ)=α}\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ\\) each of which is disjoint from others and contains at least one \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ\\) for \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}ρ_α\\) not to be empty. \\[ \\sum_{α ∈ A}ρ_α = \\sum_{α ∈ A}\\sum_{τ(σ) = α}σ = \\sum_{σ ∈ \\mathcal R}σ = 1 \\] It makes no difference to assert whether the neighborhood needs be taken relative to \\(V\\) or \\(ℝ^n\\).↩︎ Again, the supports here are taken wrto their corresponding domains of definition. Verbosely, because \\(V ∩ \\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ\\) is close in \\(V\\) by subspace topology, and it contains \\(\\{x ∈ V: σ|_V(x) ≠ 0\\}\\), hence \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ|_V ⊂ \\mathop{\\mathrm{supp}}σ\\)↩︎ Verbosely again, if \\(σ = 1\\) in a neighborhood \\(W\\) of \\(p\\) relative to \\(ℝ^n\\), \\(η = 1\\) in \\(p ∈ W ∩ V\\), which is open by subspace topology. ↩︎ Or one resorts to the Axiom of Choice for such choice function \\(τ\\)↩︎ "],["half-spaces.html", "CHAPTER 2 Half Spaces", " CHAPTER 2 Half Spaces The Stokes’ formula involves integral taken over smooth manifolds (surfaces) and their boundaries. The simplest smooth manifold for one to imagine is perhaps \\(ℝ^n\\) itself. However, it is hard to define the boundary of \\(ℝ^n\\). In fact, it is a manifold without boundary. This motivated the discussion of \\(ℍ^n\\), the simplest smooth manifold with boundary. Definition 2.1 (Half spaces) The half space of dimension \\(n\\) is given as \\[ ℍ^n := \\{x ∈ ℝ^n: π^n(x) ≥ 0\\} \\] where \\(π^n(x^1, …, x^n) = x^n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th coordinate map. Stokes’ formula also involves taking exterior derivative of a smooth differential form, the simplest of which is a real-valued smooth function, which we now define on the simplest smooth manifold with boundary. Definition 2.2 (Smoothness) A function \\(f: S → ℝ^m\\) of an open subset \\(S\\) relative to \\(ℍ^n\\) is smooth near \\(x ∈ S\\) if it admits a smooth extension in a neighborhood of \\(x\\) relative to \\(ℝ^n\\). That is, there exists \\(g: N → ℝ^m\\) smooth on an neighborhood \\(N\\) of \\(x\\) relative to \\(ℝ^n\\) such that \\(f(y) = g(y)\\) for all \\(y ∈ N ∩ S\\). The function \\(f\\) is smooth if it is smooth near all points in \\(S\\). Remark. Notice \\(S\\) does not have to be open in \\(ℝ^n\\), in which case smoothness at a point in \\(S\\) may not be defined. Even if \\(S\\) is open relative to \\(ℝ^n\\), smooth near a point \\(x ∈ S\\) can be different from that at \\(x\\). That is, it is possible that a function is smooth at a point but not smooth on any of its neighborhood. For this reason, we call the above definition smoothness near a point even though majority of the literature directly defines it as smoothness at a point. Nevertheless, the definition of smooth functions coincide when \\(S\\) is open in \\(ℝ^n\\). In other words, if \\(S\\) is open in \\(ℝ^n\\), \\(f\\) is smooth at all points in \\(S\\) if and only if \\(f\\) is smooth near all points in \\(S\\). A neighborhood of a subset \\(S\\) of \\(ℝ^n\\) is any open set that contains it as a subset. As noted before, the passage from local to global properties is partition of unity (see definition 1.3). Its application here generalizes the criterion for a function being smooth near a point to its entire domain of definition. Theorem 2.1 A function \\(f: S → ℝ^m\\) of an open subset \\(S\\) relative to \\(ℍ^n\\) is smooth if and only if it admits a smooth extension in a neighborhood of \\(S\\) relative to \\(ℝ^n\\). That is, there exists \\(g: U → ℝ^m\\) smooth on a neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(S\\) relative to \\(ℝ^n\\) such that \\(f(y) = g(y)\\) for all \\(y ∈ S\\). Proof. If \\(f\\) is smooth, then it is smooth near all points in \\(S\\) admitting smooth extensions \\[g_x: U_x → ℝ^m\\] for all \\(x\\). Put \\(U = \\bigcup_{x∈S} U_x\\), and choose \\(\\{ρ_x: U → ℝ\\}_{x∈S}\\) as a smooth partition of unity subordinate to \\(\\{U_x\\}_{x∈S}\\). Extending \\(g_x\\) to \\(U\\) by defining \\(g_x = 0\\) outside \\(U_x\\), the product \\[ ρ_xg_x: U → ℝ^m \\] is smooth because it is certainly smooth at points inside \\(U_x\\) where both functions are smooth, and also smooth at points outside \\(U_x\\) because the support of \\(ρ_x\\) and hence \\(ρ_xg_x\\) is contained inside \\(U_x\\), and the support is closed in \\(U\\). That is, any point in \\(U\\backslash U_x\\) must have a neighborhood in \\(U\\) on which \\(ρ_xg_x\\) is constantly \\(0\\). By local finiteness of partitions of unity, the function \\[ g = \\sum_{x ∈ S}ρ_xg_x \\] is locally a finite sum of smooth functions hence a smooth function itself that extends \\(f\\) to \\(U\\). Because \\[ ρ_x(y)g_x(y) = ρ_x(x)f(y) \\] for all \\(y ∈ S∩U_x\\) as \\(g_x\\) extends \\(f\\), and for all \\(y ∈ S\\backslash U_x\\) as both sides are zeroed out by \\(ρ_x(y)\\), implying \\[ g(y) = \\sum_{x ∈ S}ρ_x(y)g_x(y) = \\sum_{x ∈ S}ρ_x(y)f(y) = f(y) \\] for all \\(y ∈ S\\).
